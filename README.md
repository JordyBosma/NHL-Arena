# NHL-Arena
This is a 3D shooter game created by second year software engeneering students at NHL Stenden Hogeschool.
The game makes use of ASP.Net and WebGL and requires IIS Express to run.

We opted for a food fight instead of a classical shooter because the level design is based on the interior of our college.
Your health points are your "EC's" (study points) and your shield points are your "herkansingen" (resits). 
When your EC's drop to zero you have to "drop out". Feeling sluggish and slow? Visit the nearest coffee machine for a speed boost!
